# RRMSE-Test
A project I did to find the best Relative RMSE metric.  Relative RMSE is an accuracy metric for regression models in terms of relative units.  

However, there is no consensus about which method of calculating Relative RMSE is the best, or the "correct" method.  In the interests of leaving no stone unturned, I created a program to test all the various formulas that I could find documentation for, and then chose the one that made the most sense for me.

More explanation can be found in this video that I made about this project: https://youtu.be/a71BuSyZJ9o?si=vsg6RYrtFjxndEMA
